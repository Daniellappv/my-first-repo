# Hello

Hello and welcome to the almost daily journal of a wannabe-a-CEO. I will be posting here filtered and unfiltered braindump insights as part of my journey of becoming the CEO of a small product startup. The initial input will be related to planning and creating the near-term roadmap and goals while getting familiarized with the actual product which is already out there and is functional.

## Jan 22

* BUG: Capturing here a bug related to rendering checklists (see Jan 12 and Jan 19 notes below). TO BE FIXED.
* QUESTION: on my way to exploring the syntax and experimenting with the product, I broke my [First hand experience page](https://diary-of-a-wannabe-ceo.datahub.io/first-hand-experience) because I had added a piece of code without backticks. I need to understand more about how this works and how it is supposed to get rendered.

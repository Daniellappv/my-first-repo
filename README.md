# Hello

Hello and welcome to the almost daily journal of a wannabe-a-CEO. I will be posting here filtered and unfiltered braindump insights as part of my journey of becoming the CEO of a small product startup. The initial input will be related to planning and creating the near-term roadmap and goals while getting familiarized with the actual product which is already out there and is functional.
